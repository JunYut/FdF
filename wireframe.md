# Wireframe
![wireframe.png](wireframe.png)\
A wireframe in the context of 3D modeling and graphics is a visual representation of a three-dimensional (3D) physical object used in 3D computer graphics. It is created by specifying each edge of the physical object where two mathematically continuous smooth surfaces meet, or by connecting an object's constituent vertices using straight lines or curves.

In the context of web design and software development, a wireframe is a schematic, a blueprint, useful to help designers and clients visually understand a site's or application's functional requirements. It's a low-fidelity design layout that serves as the backbone of your design.

The term "wireframe" in your markdown file could refer to either of these concepts, depending on the context.

# Cartesian System
![3D_Cartesian.png](3D_Cartesian.png)\
The Cartesian system, also known as the Cartesian coordinate system, is a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a set of numerical coordinates, which are the signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular directed lines, measured in the same unit of length.

In 3D space, the Cartesian system is extended to include a third axis, typically labeled z, perpendicular to the other two. This results in a three-dimensional coordinate system where each point in space is specified by three coordinates (x, y, z).

The Cartesian system is named after Ren√© Descartes, who introduced it in the 17th century. It's fundamental in mathematics, physics, engineering, computer graphics, and many other fields.

# Lines
In mathematics, a line is a straight one-dimensional figure that extends infinitely in both directions. It is often described as the shortest distance between any two points.

In the context of a Cartesian system, a line can be represented by an equation in two dimensions (2D) or three dimensions (3D).

In 2D, a line is often represented by the equation `y = mx + b`, where `m` is the slope of the line and `b` is the y-intercept.

In 3D, a line can be represented in parametric form as `x = x0 + at`, `y = y0 + bt`, and `z = z0 + ct`, where `(x0, y0, z0)` is a point on the line and `(a, b, c)` is the direction vector of the line. The parameter `t` varies over all real numbers.

In the context of computer graphics and 3D modeling, a line is often represented as a sequence of points or vertices. This is particularly relevant when discussing wireframe models, where the edges of the model are represented as lines.

# Points
In mathematics, a point is a primitive notion upon which the geometry is built. Being a primitive notion means that a point cannot be defined in terms of previously defined concepts. It is only described to a certain extent, using the mental imagery that each of us has about the idea of a point.

In the context of a Cartesian system, a point is a location in space which is described by coordinates. In two dimensions (2D), a point is represented as `(x, y)`, and in three dimensions (3D), a point is represented as `(x, y, z)`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are the distances from the point to the respective axes.

In computer graphics and 3D modeling, a point often refers to a vertex, which is a data structure that contains information about a single point in space, such as its position and possibly other attributes such as color, normal vector, and texture coordinates.

# Isometric Projection

Isometric projection is a method for visually representing three-dimensional objects in two dimensions. It is a form of orthographic projection, or parallel projection, where all the projection lines are parallel to each other.

In an isometric projection, the three coordinate axes appear equally foreshortened, and the angle between any two of them is 120 degrees. This gives the viewer a way to see three dimensions without the distortion of perspective.

In 2D graphics, isometric projection is used to create an illusion of 3D, and is commonly used in video games, technical drawings, and architectural plans.

In terms of 3D graphics programming, an isometric projection can be achieved by using an orthographic projection instead of a perspective projection, and then rotating the camera to the desired angle. The orthographic projection maintains the size of objects regardless of their distance from the camera, which is a key characteristic of isometric views.
