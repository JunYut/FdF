# Computer Graphics

## 1. What is an `image` ?
In terms of computer graphics, an `image` is a two-dimensional representation of a visual scene, stored digitally in memory. It's composed of a grid of tiny elements called `pixels` (picture elements). Each `pixel` represents a single point in the `image`.

A `pixel` in an `image` has properties like color and intensity, which are typically represented as numerical values. For example, in a color `image`, each `pixel` might be represented as a combination of red, green, and blue (RGB) values. In a grayscale `image`, each `pixel` might be represented as a single intensity value.

Images can be stored in various formats, each with its own way of encoding `pixel` data and other information. Some formats are bitmap-based (like BMP, JPEG, PNG), where each `pixel`'s data is stored individually. Others are vector-based (like SVG), where the `image` is represented as mathematical shapes and patterns.
